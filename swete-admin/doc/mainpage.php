@section synopsis Synopsis

SWeTE Server is an all-in-one translation proxy server.  SWeTE is itself an acronym meaning:

- <b>S</b>imple
- <b>We</b>bsite
- <b>T</b>ranslation
- <b>E</b>ngine

@subsection howitworks How It Works

-# Install SWeTE Server on your web server.
-# Add a new "Site" in SWeTE to point to your existing website.
-# Import the pages of your site into SWeTE.
-# Translate all of the pages of the site into another language.
-# When users visit your SWeTE proxy, they'll see a translated version of your site.

SWeTE server is designed as a proxy or mirror that sits in front of your website.  If a user visits your website through the SWeTE proxy, SWeTE will first check to see if there is a translated version of the requested page and return that to the user.  If no translation yet exists, it will perform a background request to retrieve the page from your actual website and return that to the user unchanged.
